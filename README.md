# Wait-function-for-Lua

The Wait function is a flexible Lua utility that enables scripts to pause execution for a specified amount of time, without blocking the thread. It takes a single argument, Time, which should be a non-negative number representing the duration in seconds. If Time is smaller than 0.01, the function will busy-wait using the os.clock function, which provides a high-resolution timer with sub-millisecond accuracy. Otherwise, if the function is running inside a coroutine, it will use coroutine.yield to relinquish control until the requested time has elapsed. If the function is not running inside a coroutine, it will use the os.time function, which provides a coarse-grained timer with one-second accuracy, in a busy-wait loop. If Time is not a number or is negative, the function will raise an error with a descriptive message indicating the invalid argument. The Wait function is useful for controlling the timing of animations, delays, or events in games, simulations, or other Lua applications.
