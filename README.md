# Wait-function-for-Lua

A simple function that allows you to wait for a specified amount of time in Lua.

## Introduction

This function provides a simple way to pause the execution of a Lua script for a specified amount of time. It can be useful in situations where you need to delay the execution of some code, for example, to create animations, control the rate of execution of a loop, or wait for a response from an external system.

## Installation

To use the `Wait` function in your Lua script, simply copy the code from the Wait.lua file into your project.

## Usage

To use the `Wait` function, simply call it with the number of seconds you want to wait:

```lua
Wait(2) -- waits for 2 seconds
```

The function will block the execution of the Lua script for the specified amount of time, then continue.

If you call the function with a negative number or a non-number value, it will raise an error:

```lua
Wait(-1) -- raises an error
Wait("hello") -- raises an error
```

## Limitations and known issues

The `Wait` function is designed to work with Lua 5.1 and later versions. It may not work with earlier versions of Lua or with other Lua implementations.

The function is implemented using the os.clock and os.time functions, which are not precise on all platforms. This means that the actual waiting time may be longer or shorter than the specified time, especially for short waiting times. In addition, the function may consume a lot of CPU resources when waiting for very short times, as it uses a busy-wait loop.
