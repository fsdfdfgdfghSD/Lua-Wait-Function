# Wait-function-for-Lua

**Introduction:**

The Wait function for Lua is a simple utility function that allows you to pause execution of your Lua code for a specified amount of time. This can be useful in situations where you want to delay some action or wait for a certain event to occur before continuing with your code.

**How it works:**

The Wait function works by checking whether the time delay you've specified is small enough to use the os.clock function for accurate timing, or whether it's larger and requires the use of the coroutine.yield function. It then uses either the os.clock or coroutine.yield function to pause the execution of your code until the specified time has elapsed.

**Limitations and known issues:**

One limitation of the Wait function is that it blocks the entire Lua state during the wait period, which can cause issues if you're running multiple coroutines or have other time-sensitive code that needs to run concurrently. Additionally, the function can be affected by changes in system clock time, which can cause unexpected results if your code is running for long periods of time.

Overall, the Wait function can be a useful tool in certain situations, but it's important to use it carefully and be aware of its limitations.
